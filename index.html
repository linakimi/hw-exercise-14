        Large, fluffy cat breeds include the Maine Coon, Ragdoll, Persian, Siberian, and Norwegian Forest Cat, all known for bushy tails and thick coats that usually need grooming. Other popular plush breeds are the Birman, Himalayan, and British Longhair, with some, like Ragdolls and Birmans, being easier to maintain.
